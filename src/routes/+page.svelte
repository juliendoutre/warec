    >Levels are increasingly more difficult. Each one exposes a single function
    callable by Javascript: <code>hash()</code>. It returns the <A
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">sha256</A
    > sum of a flag. The goal is to retrieve the flag's original value. All flags
    follow the <code>flag{"{"}...{"}"}</code> format. You can easily check if your
    guess is correct as you have access to the answer's hash.
